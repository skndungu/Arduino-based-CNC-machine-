# Arduino-based-CNC-machine-
Its a CNC machine progemmed to operate on servo motors, the systems are programmed to work hand in hand to allow for the machining in the x, y &amp; z axis, the precison to which the servos move for the machinig process are maintained via poll setup in the code hence the system is quite on point
